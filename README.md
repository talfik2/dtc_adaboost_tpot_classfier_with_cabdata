# dtc_adaboost_tpot_classfier_with_cabdata

* In this repo, I implemented to TPOT Classifier to reach best pipeline steps, hyperparameters, and ROC AUC Score for given G2M dataset. TPOT Classifier returned Decision Tree Classifier as one of the best pipeline step. 


* Then, I measured the classification accuracy of Decision Tree Classifier with given hyperparameters. More specifically, it classified the whether Pink Cab(0) or Yellow Cab(1) suitable for investment by given G2M data. 


* After that, I tried to improve classification accuracy by Bootstrapt Aggragating.


* I also detected best hyperparameters for  Bootstrapt Aggregating by Hyperparameter Tuning Method.
