# dtc_adaboost_tpot_classfier_with_cabdata

* In this repo, binary classification algorithm is developed to help investment firm to decide whether 'Pink Cab(0)' or 'Yellow Cab(1)' taxi companies would be better for them to invest.
* To do that, I've used TPOT Classifier on data to choose the most optimal ML model along with it's params. Afterwards, I've used Bootstrapt Aggragating to reinforce the model and it's parameters.
* In this task, I've used ROC AUC Score to evaluate the model.
